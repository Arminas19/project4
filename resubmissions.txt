LO1 - 1.9: conditional loops "ARE" implemated already, please go through BookingTables view fully. Not Finished
Example of conditional loops: 

        for reservation in already_full:
            tables = reservation.tables.all()
            for table in tables:
                number_of_booked += table.people
            if number_of_booked >= 100:
                errorMessage = 'Sorry please book a different date, we are already full!, Thank You'
        except Exception as err:
            print(err)    

This code iterates through already_full and tables to check if there is enough tables left for guessed's.
