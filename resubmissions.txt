LO3 - 3.1: Got rid of the 500 server issue that was happening, also added 'Logged In' to the logged-in navbar so that the user 
knows when they have logged in. Finished

LO1 - 1.6: I placed the User Stories in their proper place. Finished

LO1 - 1.9: conditional loops "ARE" implemated already, please go through BookingTables view fully. Finished
Example of conditional loops: 

        for reservation in already_full:
            tables = reservation.tables.all()
            for table in tables:
                number_of_booked += table.people
            if number_of_booked >= 100:
                errorMessage = 'Sorry please book a different date, we are already full!, Thank You'
        except Exception as err:
            print(err)    

This code iterates through already_full and tables to check if there is enough tables left for guessed's.
